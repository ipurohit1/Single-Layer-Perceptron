# Single-Layer-Perceptron
A Python program that implements the Single Layer Perceptron algorithm, which is the basis for neurons in a neural network. Here the Perceptron algorithm is used to classify coordinates into two groups or categories.

## Project Status
The algorithm is complete, meaning the program can correctly train perceptron weights with a given learning rate and number of epochs. I may also add an activation/step function to scale the weighted sum calculated for each training example. Currently, it works for data points with an x and a y value (two dimensional) and the only data set is linearly separable. Looking to add support for data points defined by three values (three dimension) and add different data sets with differing characteristics (small, large, non-separable). 

## Requirements 
- Python3 
- numpy (Version 1.19.4 on my machine)
- matplotlib (Version 3.3.3 on my machine)

## Reflection 
This was a small side project I wanted to develop after learning about AI and machine learning concepts. The perceptron is a fairly old algorithm, but it serves as a foundational concept that more advanced algorithms build upon so I wanted to implement it so I was very familiar with how it worked and its advantages/shortcomings.
